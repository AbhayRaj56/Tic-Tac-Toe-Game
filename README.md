# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
Tic-Tac-Toe is a two-player game on a 3x3 grid where the goal is to align three symbols (`X` or `O`) in a row, column, or diagonal. Players take turns, and the game ends when someone wins or the grid is full, resulting in a draw. Itâ€™s simple yet a great way to practice strategy and quick thinking.
